# ProgressBar 
## Progress Indicators
Use progress indicators to show the status of a task. Progress indicators come in two forms: finite and infinite.

## Finite Progress Indicator
Use finite progress indicators to show the percentage of the task that's been completed. Use this only when you can accurately measure the progress of the task, such as when uploading a file.
