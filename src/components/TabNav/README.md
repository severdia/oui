# Tabs

Use tabs to put related content and features on the same page, but in separate screens.

*For example, "Pages," "Events," and "Attributes" are related, but contain separate overview tables and calls-to-action.*

## Small Tabs

You can also use smaller tabs for sub-components, or in space constrained situations, such as the editor's custom code.

Javascript and CSS are separate tabs.
