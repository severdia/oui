#Dropdowns

Use dropdowns to present a list of actions to the user. This is useful for secondary or tertiary actions, or you don't have enough room for separate buttons for each action.

Dropdown buttons should have an icon (typically a down pointing arrow) to indicate something will fly out of the button when clicked, rather than opening a modal or taking some other action.
