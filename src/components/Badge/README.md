# Status Indicators
Use status icons to indicate if a change to an experiment or campaign is live, draft, or neutral. If necessary, include the number of edits that have been made in the indicator.

Changes to any campaign or experiment that need to be published before going live, such as content, audiences, pages, etc., should all use status indicators.

## Examples

Basic status indicators. Gray is neutral and only necessary if it's more confusing to have no status indicator, orange means draft, and green means live.

Status indicators in list. They should have poptips to clarify what they mean.

Status indicators in the editor's change list. These just use a dot without numbers because each item is a discrete change.
